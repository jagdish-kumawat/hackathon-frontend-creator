## How to Use

### Start the Application

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

### Create Your First Agent

1. Click "New Agent" from the dashboard
2. Follow the 5-step wizard:
   - Basic info (name, description, domain)
   - Choose template
   - Select adapters (STT/LLM/TTS)
   - Configure prompts and policies
   - Review and create

### Test in Playground

1. Navigate to Playground
2. Select an agent or use mock
3. Click "Start Recording" for simulation
4. Watch real-time pipeline processing
5. View transcription, response, and waveform

## Technical Architecture

### Pages

- `/` - Dashboard with overview and quick actions
- `/agents` - Agent management with CRUD operations
- `/agents/new` - Step-by-step creation wizard
- `/gallery` - Template gallery with previews
- `/playground` - Testing and simulation interface

### State Management

- Agents store: CRUD operations and persistence
- Adapters store: Available adapter configurations
- Simulation store: Testing sessions and metrics
- UI store: Theme, notifications, interface state

### Mock Simulation

- Progressive STT transcription streaming
- Token-by-token LLM response generation
- Audio waveform visualization for TTS
- Realistic latency and performance metrics

## Project Highlights

- ðŸŽ¨ Beautiful, modern UI with dual themes
- ðŸ”§ Complete type safety with TypeScript + Zod
- ðŸ’¾ Persistent storage with IndexedDB
- ðŸŽ¯ No external dependencies or API calls
- â™¿ WCAG-compliant accessibility
- ðŸ“± Mobile-responsive design
- ðŸš€ Ready to use out of the box

## Security & Privacy

- No external API calls or data transmission
- All simulation runs locally in browser
- No sensitive data collection
- PII redaction warnings and controls

The application is fully functional and production-ready for use as a voice agent creator portal!

## Project Overview

Building a Next.js Creator Portal for configuring voice agent pipelines with STT (Speech-to-Text), LLM (Large Language Model), and TTS (Text-to-Speech) components. This is a purely frontend application with no backend integration.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14+ with App Router and TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with design tokens and next-themes
- shadcn/ui components (Radix primitives)
- Zustand for state management with persistence
- React Flow for pipeline editor
- React Hook Form + Zod for forms and validation
- Framer Motion for animations
- MDX for documentation
- Lucide React for icons

## Project Structure

```

## Key Features

1. Agent creation wizard with multi-step flow
2. Visual pipeline editor using React Flow
3. Mock simulation engine (no real API calls)
4. Import/Export functionality for agents and configs
5. Dual theme support (light/dark)
6. Command palette with keyboard shortcuts
7. Local persistence using IndexedDB

## Development Guidelines

- No backend code or external API calls
- All simulation is mock/local only
- Use mock data and fixtures
- Strict TypeScript with Zod validation
- WCAG-compliant accessibility
- Responsive design with mobile support
